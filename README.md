# Python-Number-Distribution
Python Number Distribution is a Python script that redistributes numbers in a list so all elements reach at least the average value. It iteratively transfers surplus values to neighboring elements until balance is achieved. This approach demonstrates a simple load balancing and redistribution method, useful for learning algorithmic data processing.
